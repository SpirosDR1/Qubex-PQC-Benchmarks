# QUBEX SENTINEL | PQC Performance Benchmarks (Chaos Engine)

A high-performance audit tool designed to measure the latency impact of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) on EVM-compatible networks. This utility implements NIST ML-DSA-44 (FIPS 204) signing and utilizes on-chain verification to ensure transparency in performance metrics.

## Why QUBEX SENTINEL?
As blockchain infrastructure transitions toward quantum resistance to combat HNDL (Harvest Now, Decrypt Later) attacks, understanding cryptographic overhead is critical. The Chaos Engine provides a deterministic way to benchmark signature latency, ensuring that PQC integration introduces virtually zero drag to high-frequency sequencer performance.

## Secure Audit Logging

Each run automatically appends verifiable data to a network-specific log file (e.g., qubex_polygon_audit.log). The audit trail provides an immutable-like record including:

Execution Timestamp (RFC3339)
Targeted Network
Average PQC Latency (ns)
Verified Blockchain Height
Signature Verification Status
