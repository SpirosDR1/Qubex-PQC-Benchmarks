# QUBEX Sentinel: Global Web3 PQC Performance Index

> This open-source repository serves as the definitive global benchmark index for Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) readiness and execution latency across L1, L2, and L3 network infrastructures.

As the Web3 ecosystem approaches the quantum migration gap, scaling protocols must adopt NIST Level 5 cryptographic primitives (Dilithium-5 / Kyber-1024) without compromising transaction throughput. The QUBEX PQC Index independently evaluates and ranks live production and testnet environments under a standardized 100,000 high-concurrency transaction stress-test.

### QUBEX SENTINEL | PQC Performance Benchmarks (Chaos Engine)

A high-performance audit tool designed to measure the latency impact of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) on EVM-compatible networks. This utility implements NIST ML-DSA-44 (FIPS 204) signing and utilizes on-chain verification to ensure transparency in performance metrics.

## Why QUBEX SENTINEL?

As blockchain infrastructure transitions toward quantum resistance to combat HNDL (Harvest Now, Decrypt Later) attacks, understanding cryptographic overhead is critical. The Chaos Engine provides a deterministic way to benchmark signature latency, ensuring that PQC integration introduces virtually zero drag to high-frequency sequencer performance.

> Rankings Policy: All benchmarks are independently conducted under strict algorithmic isolation. QUBEX isolates the PQC lattice signature verification pipeline to maintain sub-millisecond benchmarks. Environments with over 200k ns overhead show critical state-friction that must be optimized before modular Mainnet integration.

DAO Delegates & Protocol Researchers: Read the [QUBEX Genesis Framework (Migration Blueprint)](QUBEX_Genesis_Framework.md) to integrate PQC with zero downtime.

## Quick Start (Verify it yourself)

Prerequisites: Ensure you have Go installed on your machine.

1. Clone the repository:
```go
git clone https://github.com/SpirosDR1/Qubex-PQC-Benchmarks.git
cd Qubex-PQC-Benchmarks
go mod tidy
```
2. Run the Chaos Engine Stress Test:

```go
go run main.go base
``` 

*Supported networks: base, polygon, arbitrum, optimism, bnb, mantle, blast, zksync, linea, metis, scroll*

## Expected Terminal Output & Audit Trail

The tool outputs real-time signing latency and verifies connectivity to the specified network.

## Secure Audit Logging

Each run automatically appends verifiable data to a network-specific log file (e.g., qubex_base_audit.log). The audit trail provides an immutable-like record including:

* Execution Timestamp (RFC3339)

* Targeted Network

* Average PQC Latency (ns)

* Verified Blockchain Height

* Signature Verification Status

## Architecture & IP Note

*Pro Tip: For high-throughput L2/L3 testing, ensure your environment supports high-concurrency Go execution as decoupled by our production engine.*

*Security Note: This public repository contains our high-performance stress-testing engine (Go). The core PQC cryptographic logic (Python/NIST Level 5 implementations) is maintained in a private repository to protect proprietary IP. Full white-box access is granted only under NDA during commercial integration.*
