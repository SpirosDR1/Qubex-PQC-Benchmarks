# QUBEX Sentinel: Decoupled ML-DSA Pre-Batcher Shield

![Status: Active](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Devnet_Active-success) ![Security: ML-DSA](https://img.shields.io/badge/Security-NIST_Level_5-blue) ![Impact: Zero L1 Overhead](https://img.shields.io/badge/L1_Impact-Zero-brightgreen)

## Overview
QUBEX Sentinel is an enterprise-grade, decoupled Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) middleware designed strictly for EVM-compatible Layer 2 and Layer 3 ecosystems. Utilizing the NIST-standardized ML-DSA (Dilithium) algorithm, QUBEX intercepts and verifies signatures at the sequencer level (pre-batcher).

Our architecture neutralizes "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" (HNDL) vectors and achieves "Quantum-Safe by Default" sovereignty without altering L1 calldata or degrading sequencer throughput.

## Core Architecture: The "Zero L1 Impact" Paradigm
Legacy ECDSA rollups face an existential threat from quantum vectors. However, integrating PQC directly on-chain inflates gas costs to unsustainable levels. 

QUBEX solves this via a decoupled pre-batcher execution:
1. Intercept: The middleware wraps the op-node (sequencer).
2. Verify: ML-DSA signatures are mathematically verified in sub-millisecond latency (avg. ~39k ns).
3. Compress: Only verified state data reaches the op-batcher.
4. Result: Absolute PQC integrity on L2 with zero bytes of PQC overhead added to L1 calldata.

## Integration & Genesis Pilots

QUBEX Sentinel is currently selecting high-TVL Tier-1 DeFi protocols for exclusive Genesis Pilot integrations prior to full OP Stack Rollup Improvement Proposal (RIP) standardization. 

Legacy architectures are mathematically deprecated. Upgrade to QUBEX to ensure total TVL sovereignty.
