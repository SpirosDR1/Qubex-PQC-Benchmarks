## The "Quantum Collapse" & HNDL Threat
Legacy ECDSA rollups face an existential threat from quantum vectors. State actors and malicious entities are already executing "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" (HNDL) attacks—archiving encrypted L1/L2 state data to decrypt retroactively once Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers (CRQCs) come online. The choice is binary: natively proof your infrastructure, or leave your ecosystem vulnerable to total TVL extraction.

## ARCHITECTURE & OPEN-SOURCE DISCLOSURE

What this repository is: This repository contains the Cryptographic Benchmark Engine (Proof-of-Concept) used by QUBEX Sentinel. It demonstrates the sub-millisecond local execution of ML-DSA signatures (Sign & Verify) and verifies public RPC state configurations. It is designed for auditors and developers to independently verify our cryptographic latency claims.

What this repository is NOT: This is NOT the complete Qubex Pre-Batcher / Interceptor middleware. The core interceptor logic, mempool state-handling, and zero-latency sequencer-bypassing architecture are currently Closed-Source / Proprietary Infrastructure. 

*We are open-sourcing the cryptographic benchmarks to prove EVM viability. Full architectural integration will be available selectively to L2 Core Teams under NDA/partnership agreements.*

## Core Architecture: The "Zero L1 Impact" Paradigm
Integrating PQC directly on-chain inflates gas costs and state bloat to unsustainable levels. QUBEX solves this via a decoupled pre-batcher execution:

1. Intercept: The middleware wraps the op-node (sequencer).
2. Verify: NIST-standard ML-DSA-87 signatures are mathematically verified in sub-millisecond latency.
3. Compress: Only verified state data reaches the op-batcher.
4. Result: Absolute PQC integrity on L2 with zero bytes of PQC overhead added to L1 calldata.

## Live Devnet Omnichain Benchmark (Latest Audit Update)
*Executed via QUBEX Omnichain Broadcaster on commercial-grade hardware. Architecture is fully upgraded to support extreme parameter sets.*

Load Test Parameters:
* Security Standard: NIST Level 5 (ML-DSA-87)
* Operations: 2.2 Million Concurrent PQC Operations (1.1M Sign + 1.1M Verify)
* Concurrency: 11 Tier-1 EVM Ecosystems Simultaneously
* Total Execution Time: ~1m 10s

| Target Ecosystem | Signing Latency | Verification Latency | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Arbitrum | 476,748 ns (~0.47 ms) | 179,985 ns (~0.17 ms) | SECURED |
| zkSync | 532,161 ns (~0.53 ms) | 186,484 ns (~0.18 ms) | SECURED |

| Blast | 1,057,001 ns (~1.05 ms) | 134,870 ns (~0.13 ms) | SECURED |
| Polygon | 1,401,724 ns (~1.40 ms) | 74,529 ns (~0.07 ms) | SECURED |
| Mantle | 1,395,950 ns (~1.39 ms) | 78,393 ns (~0.07 ms) | SECURED |
| Linea | 1,709,490 ns (~1.70 ms) | 70,578 ns (~0.07 ms) | SECURED |
| Scroll | 1,813,690 ns (~1.81 ms) | 58,989 ns (~0.05 ms) | SECURED |

> Hardware Scalability Note: The above logs reflect extreme stress-testing under *consumer-grade CPU bottlenecks*. The QUBEX decoupled algorithm inherently solves PQC overhead, engineered to scale at < 100,000 ns latency per operation when deployed on Enterprise Bare Metal architectures (e.g., AWS Graviton, 64+ core instances).

## The QUBEX Trust Index
Integrating QUBEX Sentinel immediately enrolls your network into the QUBEX Trust Index—the emerging industry standard for quantum-resilient liquidity. Chains with high Trust Index scores provide institutional capital the cryptographic guarantee required for the next decade of Web3 operations.

## Omnichain Reproduction & Local Verification
*"Don't trust, verify."* QUBEX Sentinel operates with absolute cryptographic transparency. Enterprise architects and protocol core developers can independently reproduce the 2.2M operations stress test locally.

Infrastructure Prerequisites:
* Go Environment: Version 1.20 or higher.
* Hardware: Multi-core CPU. *(Warning: The benchmark is designed to force 100% CPU thread exhaustion to simulate peak enterprise sequencer loads. Proceed with caution on commercial laptops).*

Execution Protocol:
Run the following commands in your terminal to initialize the omnichain broadcaster:

### 1. Clone the infrastructure repository

```go
git clone [https://github.com/SpirosDR1/Qubex-PQC-Benchmarks.git](https://github.com/SpirosDR1/Qubex-PQC-Benchmarks.git)
```

```go
cd Qubex-PQC-Benchmarks
```

### 2. Synchronize cryptographic dependencies (Cloudflare CIRCL ML-DSA)

```go
go mod tidy
```

### 3. Ignite the Devnet Broadcaster

```go
go run main.go
```

## Integration & Genesis Pilots

QUBEX Sentinel is currently in the MVP Phase, actively selecting high-TVL Tier-1 DeFi protocols and Rollup-as-a-Service (RaaS) providers for exclusive Genesis Pilot integrations prior to full EVM-wide protocol standardization.

Networks participating in the Genesis Pilot phase are eligible for Strategic Integration Bounties (subsidized from our Ecosystem Grants allocation) to eliminate the financial friction of transitioning to a quantum-safe architecture.

### Initiate Integration:

To request a technical handoff, review the Trust Index framework, and secure a Genesis Pilot slot, submit your protocol's architecture for review by our core team.
